Some want a cat to cuddle and sit on their laps; others are happy to live with a very independent cat which spends most of its time outside and doesn\u2019t want too much human interaction.","image":"cat-page1"},"page2":{"title":"To care for a cat you will need to:","paragraph":"","image":"cat-page2"},"page3":{"title":"How much care and attention does a cat need?","paragraph":"As pets go, cats are relatively low maintenance compared to dogs which need companionship, walking, training etc. However, like any pet, they do need care, and some cats need more care than others. Do you want to spend a lot of time with your cat, do you want it to be demanding, or do you have limited time? Cats can fit into busy, modern lifestyles more easily than dogs, as they are pretty independent, can be left alone much more easily and are more suitable for smaller flats or houses. Cats are often chosen by people who have busy and stressful lifestyles and who want some companionship when they go home to relax.","image":"cat-page3"},"page4":{"title":"Can I keep a cat on vegetarian food?","paragraph":"Are you a vegetarian and want your cat to be one too? If you want a vegetarian pet that won\u2019t challenge your beliefs, then it would be better to get a rabbit \u2013 a cat is a carnivore first and foremost, and looks and behaves as it does for just this reason.  A cat is what is called an obligate carnivore \u2013 it has an absolute need for some of the nutrients found in meat and all of its senses of smell and taste are atuned to being a carnivore \u2013 it would be unfair and very dangerous to health to even attempt keeping it as a vegetarian.","image":"cat-page4"},"page5":{"title":"Can I keep a cat indoors?","paragraph":"If you think about the lifestyle of a cat which has access outdoors you will realise that being outdoors brings a huge variety to its life and allows it to use all of its hunting behaviours if it wants to. Of course, there are risks outside for cats, but you need to balance these with the very positive aspects of physical and mental stimulation and an outlet for natural behaviour.","image":"cat-page5"},"page6":{"title":"Can I have a cat with a baby or young children?","paragraph":"There is no reason not to have a cat or kitten if you have children.  It is up to parents to teach their children from the very beginning how to approach, stroke and handle cats and to treat them kindly.  Many children have fantastic relationships with their cats and learn about respecting other creatures and being gentle \u2013 it is done successfully all the time, but it is up to parents to lay down the rules. Perhaps taking on a new kitten when you have a new baby or a toddler might be a lot to handle at once, so ensuring you have time for all the parties is part of a successful relationship. Likewise, if you are pregnant there is no need to get rid of the cat. Simple and basic hygiene precautions and common sense management of the cat, while the baby is small, can ensure all cohabit happily and safely.","image":"cat-page6"},"page7":{"title":"Should I get an adult cat or a kitten?","paragraph":"A kitten gives you the opportunity to take on an animal right from the beginning and treat it and care for it so that it gets the best start in life. You will also be able to get some idea of its character. However, kittens require a lot of attention and some forethought to prevent them from getting into trouble. If you leave them alone you have to make sure they will be safe while you are away. You may also have to organise neutering, initial vaccinations and so on, depending on where you get your kitten from.","image":"cat-page7"},"page8":{"title":"What sex of cat should I get?","paragraph":"The sex of a kitten doesn\u2019t really matter, as long as you neuter your kitten before it reaches puberty (at about four months of age) when the influence of sex hormones kick in. Un-neutered cats may exhibit unwelcome reproductive behaviours. For example, un-neutered male cats will mark their territory with strong smelling urine while un-neutered female cats can come into season every two weeks if they do not become pregnant.","image":"cat-page8"},"page9":{"title":"Can I have a cat if I have a dog?","paragraph":"If you have other pets there should not be a problem in getting a cat, but you just need to make sure that you take everything into consideration.  If you have a dog you just need to make sure that you make introductions carefully so that your new cat is not chased or injured while the dog gets used to it. Not all dog types make good companions for cats.","image":"cat-page9"},"page10":{"id":2,"title":"About this site...","paragraph":"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
